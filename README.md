This program automates the selection process for applicants to the Excel-erate class held at Do Space. Previously, employees manually selected applicants based on priority criteria: lowest salary groups, lowest education groups, and underrepresented identities. This new program significantly reduces the selection time from 10-20 minutes to less than a minute.

To use the program, a Do Space employee needs to download the applicant response sheet as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file and save it in the same folder as the program. When run, the program prompts the user to input the total class capacity. Once entered, it generates a new CSV file named "acceptedPatrons" in the same location. This new file contains the names and email addresses of both accepted and waitlisted applicants. Waitlisted applicants are included in case of withdrawals. The output is saved as a CSV to allow easy import into Google Sheets, facilitating access for other staff members.

Example files for the Applicant list and Accepted Applicants are provided. Please note that the Applicant list contains empty rows, as not all fields are utilized. Additionally, the sample data uses random characters that do not necessarily correspond to actual yearly income, race, or other traits. This program streamlines the applicant selection process, ensuring efficiency and adherence to the established priority criteria.
